# english-to-swahili-Edge-machine-learning
A machine learning edge project that translates english to swahili.
Following are the procedures for using machine translation on an edge device to translate from English to Swahili:
(1)assemble a database of sentences in English and Swahili.
The format can be in CSV.
(2)Tokenize the sentences and divide the dataset into training and test sets as part of the preprocessing.
the code is given 
(3)Utilize the training set to train a machine learning model.
You can utilize an encoder-decoder architecture using LSTM or GRU units as an example of a neural machine translation (NMT) model.
(4)Utilize the test set to assess the model's performance.
(5)Reduce the model's size and processing demands by optimizing it.
(6)Transform the model into a TensorFlow Lite or other edge device-friendly format.
